# sorting-algorithm-visiualisations

just had an exam for data structures and algorithms and i want to make it easier for students to be able to visualise how sorting algorithms work when learnings for the first time

## so far i have bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort
### going to add merge, quick sort and algorithms that relate to graphs
