just had an exam for data structures and algorithms and i want to make it easier for students to be able to visualise how sorting algorithms work when learnings for the first time

## so far i have bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort
## implemented Breadth-first search and Depth-first search

going to work on graphs now
